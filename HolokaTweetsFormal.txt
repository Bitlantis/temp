Super Mario Galaxy was more boring for me but it definitely played way better
I bet if I just didn't check notifications for a week I could get to 5
I only played halfway through it till I got frustrated and quit 💀

Yeah! There is too little food and prices are rising fast. Biden is not our president.
Yeah, this is almost a dangerous amount of knowledge. what's your opinion on the current overpopulation? 7 million people is way too much
Yup. I wish I had at least 0.00000000000000000000001% of your knowledge
Nothing, man, nothing.
Where funny
I can't see funny

He gave you up.
Well he has a point
I haven't used a Huawei phone in a while but from what I've seen they're still good, and they hold up pretty well.

iPhones are also quite good, but they have some minor flaws that should be resolved, like the lack of a system-wide back gesture.
Expressing your own opinion from outside isn't taking away the affected group's right to talk about it.
Lmao why is it on vs marketplace in the first place? They aren't gonna succeed, most coders are smarter than this
This kind of gatekeeping is what keeps me from having an enjoyable life. You don't need to be a woman to say calling women females is dehumanizing. Same for all the other examples of this type of gatekeeping.
Sorry. I didn't think of looking at your profile first.

Stop saying dumbass things, you're not even making sense. For real.
I like this kind of "fever dream" music with seemingly random notes. Please keep making these, they are really cool and I like them.
That or just download the YouTube version
Bruh they aren't even conscious yet
Technically it is alive but it doesn't have thoughts and feelings, which makes it perfectly fine to kill in my opinion. It's not the same as killing a full on baby that has thoughts and feelings. I am just talking out of my ass but I think they should keep abortions legal.

This image is too funny to be on Twitter. Delete this.
Sorry but not really, you're quite friendly though.
Theres an easy solution to that, and it’s called downloading MP3s from shady websites.
Contrary to popular belief, there are no good free VPNs. They all make money by selling your data to third parties.

My phone (which cost 200 euro new, the Redmi Note 9 Pro) still runs perfectly, after about two years with it. About as well as the day I bought it.

Just search advanced system settings click performance and enable font smoothing from there
That's literally what I did before I switched back to Windows though
Yes
Windows 7 was the best until everyone dropped support

Windows version dies and suddenly every single developer stops supporting it too
I just wanna say I don't know what the deleted comment says so if anyone can provide me with information that will be greatly appreciated
I hope this is satire because if it isn't you're wrong. Men are people too.
You live with an upside down watermelon slice
Hi
Uh
Just for this response you're based
It's also the most secure platform due to its obscurity and "unpopularity"
It can sync with Android and iOS (KDE Connect)
It's a lot lighter than Windows (talking about Manjaro KDE)
You don't have to install from the internet, there are both CLI and GUI package managers (GNOME software, Pamac Manager, KDE Discover)
It literally runs on a Nintendo 64
Unity is a lot like macOS (in a good way, like the global menu, which is arguably the best macOS feature) and I like that
I have internal graphics but guess what? They're unsupported too!
vcouc
And it works well
And it's free
And you can edit it to be exactly like you want
And you can install Windows apps
And you can (almost) install macOS apps
should i continue?
I also use the index for the left button like normal people
I could, but I also need AirPlay to Mac so I can't just use 11, 10.15, or older
index like normal people?
That explains it, thanks!

What?
:/
I am tired of saying you're right so please just stop replying
I used a Microsoft account so I don't know, but I don't think it lets you skip either. I'll check later.
I like KDE better. But linux is linux so take that as you will
You are right. This is really tall. But I think you can disable it via registry/winaero tweaker. Anyway, this is a Windows 10 problem, not a Windows 11 problem.
These are all true. However, I installed W11 Pro for Workstations and it came with minimal bloatware, nothing too extreme. You are correct, just not entirely so.
Ew no that's GNOME

I'll take KDE Plasma
Do you really care that much about seconds on a clock? While they should have kept it I don't care so Windows 11 is an improvement for me.

You should stop focusing on the details and look at the bigger picture.
By then I'll be able to have a job and afford one hopefully
This is actually something I agree with for once

Linux is the best kernel (what you're referring to as Linux is in fact GNU/Linux, or as I've recently taken to call it, GNU plus Linux)
Also, I noticed 11 being a huge improvement over Windows 10 because with 10 the only possible outcome was improvement
I would agree with you but when I did I had to install all the drivers manually, I couldn't install any of the programs I needed, and it didn't perform all that much better because my PC is already good enough
I didn't think of that, thank you for explaining this
I wish I could go back to macOS but I can't run monterey because my GTX 780 isn't supported anymore 💀 so yeah I'm stuck with Windows 11 and I feel the same way

I guess it's your PC so it's fine but I find that really ugly

Not me lol
True but I think being chased by police and being in prison for however long the sentence is adds to the experience
Yeah but why did you disable font smoothing? I'm pretty sure that hurts your eyes too and not just mine, right?
I'm also gonna switch to more tech-related content. I am considering running my current main channel as a secondary English language gaming channel.
I will record a video on my channel announcing this change soon. It will have my voice, and be scripted, but right now I am stuck on chrome OS (help please) so I gotta sort that out first.
Never daily drove an iPhone but I find myself constantly using the volume buttons to switch to mute (and missing the button sometimes) so I guess that's right.
Well, IPA files exist, but the issue is that they can't be installed without jailbreak (as a side effect they can only be installed on older devices) and that epic will likely never release IPA files due to them being a huge corporation
Bring your games to Linux, or at least make them run through wine, which seems like a decent compromise.
I only just noticed but hi
Nah mate
Fuck you
fact that in English YouTube you have way less opportunities and a lot more competition. Which inevitably leads to most people failing. In Italian YouTube, there is a lot less competition, which is why I wanna do this. (2/2)
I gotta be honest with you guys, I've been thinking of stopping English YouTube and starting to do YouTube in my native language (Italian) again. If I do this will have no effect on my Twitter, but I'm not 100% sure yet. The main thing that pushed me to do this is the (1/2)

it's just a fat hoe

that sounds wrong out of context
well at least pants (i hope), and a shirt
i really did nothing that i'm proud of lol
well it's sony's fault so not a ratio
thanks but I googled it 💀
i deleted the screenshot but now I'm curious
what can ppl actually do with a ban id
Trans women are women, therefore if anyone says that trans women should not compete with women in sports, they are saying trans women aren't women, but they are calling them trans WOMEN, so it's a contraddiction.

That's why it's stupid along with many other reasons.
bruh

no the notification literally said that
i have mobile notifications on pc that's why

"opening imovie"
i only open imovie when i have issues with kdenlive 💀
Well, they didn't decide Firefox wasn't cool anymore, it's just that Chrome has a monopoly on the market

I use mainly Gecko and Webkit based browsers because of that (Mi Browser on mobile and Safari on desktop)
so it's basically a pwa but worse because it's its own process?
I don't like jellybean's content but I think this is a massive goal, they earned my respect

Same energy as WINE is not an emulator
Why? It makes sense that Sonic meeting his past self would cause a timeline split.
Your point is valid, but I always have all my stuff connected to the same Wi-Fi so it's invalidated for me.

Apple sync is probably the best in the industry but I still choose Android because:

1. Broke

2. I'm a customization nerd, I always customize my stuff to my liking.
I made myself bald again last month
Just thought it'd be relevant
I am not against Apple, in fact I like their stuff quite a lot, it's just kind of janky in a lot of ways.
Well, it is Apple we're talking about, the same company that still puts Lightning on their phones despite the EU encouraging them to switch to the USB-C standard.
no hate btw
i am personally not a jellybean fan but this is some good art, 9/10.
well if they unfollowed you for that they are probably people you don't want

yeah mee6 is one of the worst bots on discord
mainly because of its nfts but also all of the basic features locked behind a paywall
hopefully
What I mean by this is that the base vent design being different is due to an older design, tho I didn't model the leak so I wouldn't know.
Yeah the leaked design was probably just an older concept.

Ikr it costs nothing for them to go on google and sign up for a personal email
bro needs a /j to know if something is a joke or not
Lol a store near my home has more than one PS5 in stock and has them on display

Now if only I had the money to get one...
that's why you should do the clap test before recording 3 hours of footage
fmodel screenshot or it's not real
And also apparently how PSN works too lol it took me 12h to download Fortnite on PS4

I just wanted to check console out lmao
this is such a blatant scam lmao
I had that on my old banned account lol
indeed i am
This pic goes hard
As all sigma males know, pee is stored in the balls.

I hope his channel becomes a literal dream, he and his community are so toxic, compared to other Minecraft YTs and streamers, even smaller ones.
honestly he is annoying
same lol
I am going to get rid of the entire galaxy
Plus the forces model is way too high poly lol, it's 28k i think vs the 19k of the unleashed model

noooo
I write with my right ear
Before was was was, was was is.
what the fuck
International Curesd day*
how the fuck
took me a minute
Wait you just reminded me
What did you seriously expect?
One gives off Sonic Unleashed vibes, one gives off Sonic 4 vibes.
One of them has the best shoes of the series, I'll let you decide which one.
He's Rayman
I'm past being Italian, I decided I'm British now, mate.
Nintendo seal of quality IGN 10/10 Featuring Dante from the Devil May Cry™ series
We now have to ratio people on YouTube because of the dislike button just being useless for 90% of people

I seriously hope they revert this change
Prepare to work double or triple!
ayo?
No that is Sonic Adventure 7
You are cooler than me
good? no

memeable? absolutely yes
ouch when did you start
Old tweet, but on switch I believe you can map the buttons in the system menu.
Sonic 3 &amp; Knuckles &amp; Knuckles &amp; Knuckles
holy shit

i bet the wii version emulated in dolphin would run way better
"Sonic was never good"
Imagine trusting IGN for game reviews lol, I wouldn't do it even ironically.
me when
what's stopping them from just not logging in lol
And it doesn't even work lol (It's so damn easy to crack)
Yeah, Wii/PS2 Unleashed has hallway-like level design, the Werehog was bad, and don't even get me started on the boost.

Xbox 360/PS3, on the other hand, is a great game, with level design that actually feels thought out, and the Werehog is actually good here.
you can't just post 2D art and expect people to think it's 3D /j

Jokes aside, good job!
Sonic Kart
I can confirm, you are the best.
thanks mate
yay it's my twitter's first anniversary
vouch vouch vcouc vouchj vouch
I vouch so hard bro
yeah but it's goog*e mine sweeper 🤢
too late unfortunately
Lmao if people bought Android Flappy Bird phones they are dumb.

Not because it's Android, but because Android lets you download a Flappy Bird apk.
Not even in the iOS widgets lol
Wait what it's your birthday? Happy Birthday!
What did they do?
WOO! yeah cool
honestly though, that looks almost exactly like my hand minus some major injuries
bruh why did you post my hand
that would actually be sick
Wow that's so cool!
Games mainly display static images for the HUD, so if you play games on it, it's gonna have burn-in.
That screen is gonna have really bad burn-in 2 months from now.
sussy 😳
ayo m8 wtf
ew bench tails ewwww ewwwwwww
14 - 16 most likely
twitter  is a website
Well, to be honest, the Apple set is 3 pieces so it does make sense it would be a third of the cost of the whole set.
because 💀 + 🗿 = 🪵 and 🪵 + 🪓 = 🪑

actually idk
ever forget about something ur doing and then remember it like 12 hours later
This is a linux terminal so CTRL+Shift+Z
this game is so glitchy and i love it
she's 12
every type of clothing is small for a morbidly obese person
also while I'm here

is it just me or has twitter not been recommending your tweets?
eh almost
foodnight
lemme try to say goodnight with my eyes closed
1st : that kinda looks like me

2nd : got any unsee juice?
huh
Metropolis
brown doesn't exist
my twitter is dead in its coffin lmao
That's absolutely true for me, Mario 64 was fine, but Sonic Adventure was just amazing for me.
Sonic Jam 6
to me it looks to be 240
I agree, but just leave DR and UT in their place.
I'd like to have the original SADC models, just with the higher poly count of SADX
At first I legit thought that it was the original stage with Sonic in Mario 64, not the stage in SA1 lmao
Seriously though, laughing at a kid because their grandma died is absolutely disgusting, if I were the kid I would have just asked to have them kicked out of the room.
So they are ironically going against their own religion by using said religion as a means of making fun of people.
It's weird how people don't follow the rules that they are imposing on themselves.
Really? so most if not all religions have this in their rules, interesting.
I'm atheist but I still live by the "don't do to others what you don't want to be done to you".

It's what I think everyone should live by, no matter religion, ethnicity, or nationality.

I don't want to hurt people because they will hurt me if I do, that's so obvious.
Like when they accidentally gave Sonic fat arms for a second or two.
bruh wtf
now lemme say something: the floor is made out of floor

every 60 seconds in africa a minute passes

the main cause of death is dying
it is
i hate it when that happens
fuck it, i own the moon.
at full price
Also, good night.
I woke up a few hours ago, at 1 AM.

I got into bed at 3PM.

So sorry, I can't sleep at a healty hour.
took me a minute, a fucking minute.

it's fake.
why you posting this shit on the official sonic post
That's kinda sus
sus
I said sega because they are the damn publisher
Actually it was after adventure, 3D Blast Saturn was released after Sonic Adventure in Japan
Update: I've officially gone crazy
no it was sega
Best way to go is just putting it on VHS though.
Fun is subjective, in my opinion some levels are fun, some are just a disaster, and some are just complete trash.

Lost valley is trash.

Network terminal is eh.

Mortar Canyon is the best level in the game.
That's the point
That's not French Sonic, that's Japanese Sonic.

Instead, for Sonic 2, European copies used the US box art.

For Sonic 3 Sega of Europe made their own box art.

Sonic Mania used the Japanese design.
one question

what's nine plus ten?
yooo it's #nineten21 let's GOOOOOOO
Because I wanted to finally play Sonic Colors after 11 years.
YEESSSSS
That's not my reason though, I have a PC and a PS4. I got the switch version because I hadn't bought any switch games before SCU.
it's local, i can tell because it starts with 192, if it started with literally anything else (excluding 127, that's localhost) it would have been more believable
Alright, so, I want to make a Minecraft video and I have no ideas, and I need some for my video (obviously) so please leave some ideas in the comments.
what is this dumbass doing? that's a local ip address
you forgot act 4
that fucking reason is marketing, people in 2013 were fucking dumb just as i am today, and wanted a cheap xbox one so they just got the 360 e and then shut their fucking mouth
hi cusred
Weirdly enough, light blue and pink.
twitter
(The religious thing is a joke, I don't believe in anything at all)
Sonic the Hedgehog because, well, it's Sonic the Hedgehog, and I follow Sonic stuff religiously.
Mario is for pussies, Sonic is cool. And the flossing in the movie? It was the right decision, it ties in with Sonic observing from far away, and he saw kids doing it, and that's why he does it twice in the movie. It's just a cool piece of continuity.
The "It's ARM because it's handheld" is correct, the running in two modes thing is the clock speeds changing between docked and portable mode.
It's not because it's handheld, it doesn't matter here, it's the fact it's made to run in two modes, and it's underpowered compared to even the PS4 and Xbox One (Standard config). It's also an ARM console.
It honestly could be anything, even a small oversight in the game's code, from my knowledge, this is based on the original code, that had to be heavily rewritten, and this does not happen on the original Wii release, so it's probably that.
Well, so you're suggesting that this memory corruption thing is due to how different libraries handle code?

I have some coding experience, but it's limited to self-taught Visual Basic (the .NET variant) so I don't know how libraries work.
Also, let's say hypothetically I manage to load up the PC version with 4GB of ram (4096MB, equivalent to the Switch), would it cause the same issues as the Switch version?
Ah yes, memory leaks, my favorite type of bugs.

Well, anyways, it's really bad but I only tested it out on Tropical Resort so I don't know how much it affects the other worlds.

It might be better or worse.
I think they are going to release a patch soon, if it gets released I will test it out.
You're both right, you both get a medal.
*cries in poor*

Honestly though I wouldn't change anything, keep up the great work!
That's a weird way to spell Sonic Adventure 1 for the Sega Dreamcast released on September 9, 1999.
I own many consoles, and the 360 is the best of them in terms of game library in my opinion, good choice, and good post.
This is where you're right, an example of this is Sonic Unleashed in Xenia, it shows a black screen if the emulator isn't modified with game specific patches.
So you're saying downloading an encrypted ROM is legal, because you said that without decrypting it on your own is illegal, so based on this logic it's legal to just download an encrypted, raw ROM.
It's not $60 though, it's $40 assuming you are using the USD.
They are not, the only glitch I encountered that wasn't audio related was activated with a specific set of actions. Do they need to fix it? Absolutely yes, Is it as bad as Twitter makes it out to be? No, but only by "this much", You gotta do the glitch yourself.
Got context?
it does help
If it helps I got a Nvidia GTX 780, so it's a bit older, and might have these same issues, seeing as it's Kepler and switch uses Maxwell (The successor to Kepler)
Adding onto this: When I get my PC copy I will check if these kinds of glitches (seizure glitches) happen only on switch or also on PC.
Can I go back to playing 06, which looks and works better?
To do the glitch you gotta switch hub worlds quickly and enter Tropical Resort Act 1.

I am not responsible for any seizures.

I am not sure if it works on any other levels.
How did this get past QA testing? It's got literal vertex explosions.

Btw, this is on a real, unmodded Switch, but I did the glitch myself.
It's the camera
Play the best Sonic game according to IGN, Sonic Pocket Adventure for the NeoGeo Pocket Color
they aren't there in the final release
some*
There have been instances of sone hacks breaking games, but I'm not entirely sure this applies to SCU
And yes, I checked because some of the source code from the original is still there, the glitch does not occur on the Wii version, checked via Dolphin in the most accurate setting.
Thing is, I still had to do it manually.
The 1.0 version can be hacked though
That's fake, look closer mate.

That's true, but the game technically still isn't out, they announced the release date as September 7, we are on the 6th day of the month of September in the year 2021.
I have two questions:

1) What's your favorite water brand?

2) If I gave Shadow... fifteen apples... and then Amy gave Shadow SIXTEEEEEN... and Tails took away three... my question is... what's the total mass of the sun?
What I'm trying to say is that the Switch port of Colors Ultimate is not an earlier and/or buggier build.
Another thing is that people on Twitter will do anything for followers, and when they get caught, they delete all proof.

Now, don't get me wrong, I am not defending these people, but they have every right to do so.
I'd like to add that there are ways to tamper with the popular Switch emulator, Yuzu, because it's open source, therefore, anyone with a bit of coding experience can make it run wrong.
My source for this is that I own the Switch port of SCU.
Attention, people!
The Nintendo Switch port of Sonic Colors Ultimate is nowhere near as broken as Twitter clout chasers show you, as they are using emulators, which are known for their instability.

Please do not fall for this.
no shit

kids don't do crack!
people should stop saying 1+1=2 because we all know it is 11.
broo same
wait aren't you the music guy?
Oh btw the stream is gonna be on YouTube
Thinking of doing a stream in like a week, you have 4 game choices:
I know this is a meme and all, but I think I am quite similar to Sonic the Hedgehog, and here's why:

I like running fast
I like nature
I like technology but only to a certain extent
I am an athletic person
I dislike evil (As everyone should)
I think nature should be preserved
woah i thought it was a deez nuts joke, and you proved me right
What's sugondese?
ah yes, hair, my favorite continent.
well I'm still waiting for my dad to come back for the milk
even sonic fucking 4 didn't have that
damn that's classic knuckles
aw don't lie
@Curesd_
Twitter be like: someone says something that's not even remotely racist/sexist

8 years later someone finds it and cancels them

then they get all sad and angry when someone disagrees with them

man this platform sucks
no they become big minors
wow
wow good thing school starts on september 13

also the name is misleading, school is not cool
Ok so most of you may or may not like the Sonic the Hedgehog series, and that's fine, but can we all agree that the music is great?
yay I'm in the outer ring
I will do the VA work.
I used up the entire character limit on that. Also I might animate it in 3D with the Santiago Generations model and an upscaled Saturn Sonic model.
Sonic was found, he isn't dead! He was just on his 23 year journey to find Santiago, and fight him epically, the meet-up transcript:

Sonic: Found you, faker!
Santiago: ...
Sonic: Huh?
Santiago: ...
Sonic: Alright, let's see who's the real Sonic!
Santiago: ...
*epic fight begins*
that's so cool, dude!
Adding to this on my main, If you just hit anyone out of nowhere, you are a piece of shit regardless.
bruhhhh same
i will, my higher authority.
it is an ip address, but it's a local one so it's practically useless
Ah yes, child eater.

Kid consumer if you will.

Family descendant devourer if you so desire.
hi
reply if you are cool
well, twitter is 13+ so your suggestion is trash
I can't decide if it's better or worse than mine
this is so wrong that the sonic model is from heroes, not adventure 1.
those legs are a sonic boom level of long
also, this is a fucking cartoon.
not only this is not incest, this is her son.
ok buddy
why do you hate furries
twitter is blue though
Feminists when they realize its humanity and not huwomanity
why do people
cannot relate
television
ok i see
wait why does the text look weird

it looks different but i can't point my finger on it
you both achieved peak comedy status
h pee
I swear I was watching that episode while this was posted.
Forces definitely, I like 06 better, but Forces has a lot of replay value that 06 lacks.

I replayed Forces again and again and didn't get tired.
did i just mess it up
I'll make you eat those words!
Faker? I think you're the fake hedgehog around here.
Does anyone else have this sudden urge to run fast sometimes?

I like running and tricks so maybe that's why I have this sudden urge sometimes.
Sonic and Silver match perfectly

also shadow, but shadow's skin tone is darker
you both get a like because you're both right
this guy looks like they told him to be there or be square and he wasn't there

i dont either and i only use it for like scene building for renders and that's it
ok
ok why not tweet twice

sometimes i worry my pizza pasta sauce italian accent is too noticeable
yes but like i should have been sleeping a long ass time ago

that design wasn't bad, it was horrible.

tbh would have made for a good creepypasta
inspired me, and now i want to make a saturn style sonic game, any ideas?

(must not involve flying)
it needs more colors, saturn games had a bit more, but everything else is really really cool!
which doesn't even make sense because not even 1% of youtube channels have 50m subs so it wouldn't have been that expensive
what

school starts in September for me and we need to have a pass to go to school, and to get the pass you need a vaccine, which I don't wanna do cause of those stories you hear, so i gotta participate remotely, but my school is worried that I'll play video games.

bye i guess
really cool
i wanna watch it but its fake
ok
me when outrunning a black hole on foot while kinda tired, in space, sideways.

just a normal day
me when i am not good
Be careful! if you're gonna actually do this please follow the hardware limitations of the saturn. don't make the characters too high poly or else the game will have to look like a snes game with the sfx2 chip
branye
well, this is the perfect opportunity to say you're my favorite sonic voice actor, and I'm definitely going to hear more from you
There was an attempt at censoring the username
e
yeeeeah
Honestly, same.
no*
yeah right, but do I care? nom
then what? if i get cancelled I'll only have people under my tweets harassing me.
Twitter is the asshole of the internet.
It's a remake in another engine, not a remaster, so it's normal the file size is larger, since their new engine is less size optimized.
which is what i just said

it's packed with content
dude you are so cool
a billion+ people saw your face
VOUCH VOUCH VOUCH VOUCH
noah get the boat
post fake pain
pog
I know. I should have listened.

But what can I do about it? Do you have any unsee juice?
Oh, Oh. I found out. 

That's pretty bad.
I know who that is, but why are they trending?
i hate you :(
you
hmm i think imma click on them
but before i do it im gonna set up a proxy
sad
Quick tip: If you're gonna draw Sonic characters, don't go from memory, and try to replicate the curves as well as you can.
screw it no video
screw it I'm doing all of them
alright
